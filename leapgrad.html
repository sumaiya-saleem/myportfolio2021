		<p class="inner-p mt-2"> LeapGrad is a digital start-up based in Toronto, and is creating a two-sided student networking platform, targeted to both students and employers. This platform addresses the problem of the student job search and networking experience, and how platforms like LinkedIn currently don’t prioritize or motivate students in this process. As a UX researcher & designer, I analyzed the existing platform, and what can be improved in order to support its organization's goal of improving the student job search and networking experience. </p>

			When I first joined LeapGrad, they had over 1000 registered users on their web and mobile platfrom (this case study will focus on the mobile interface), with three core features shown below: profile page, content feed (to upload and view photos/videos), and a jobs page.
			<img src="images/leapgrad/original-screens.png" alt="original platform screens" width="100%" class="mt-5">
			</p>

			<p class="inner-p pt-4">

			I conducted a Heuristic Analysis of the site, as well as synthesized user data analysis from web analytics, with key findings summarized below. My goal for the following steps was to uncover why this inactivity was taking place, and what underlying issues were.

		<p class="inner-p"> After understanding the level of inactivity on the different features, my goal was to uncover why this inactivity was taking place. Therefore, when I conducted user interviews and testing sessions, I not only wanted to understand the interaction problems with the current platform, but also go back to the orginal problem space, uncovering pain points, motivations, and why competitors are failing to provide this experience.

			<ol>
				<li> Provide a relatable content feed to students</li>
				<li> An aesthetic and appealing profile</li>

			<p class="inner-p"> As my first UX role after completing my undergraduate degree, I was able to apply my skills when leading the platform's redesign. Gaining thorough experience in all aspects of research and design process- from discovery to shipment- I now have a strong understanding of best methods and practices when attempting to understand user needs and pain points. I am most proud of the fact that I was able to define the organizations UX practices, and reconstructed the approach for how they approach new ideas, including workflow and design handoff. Next steps for this project would be analyzing each feature and how it is performing, talking to users, and evaluating new avenues for improvement.
