				<h2 class="sub-heading">Overview</h2>
				<p class="inner-p mt-2">Alongside the supervision of my professor, I designed Bread Pledge as an app that aims to connect businesses who have food to be rescued, to organizations serving communities in need. The UX case study aims to solve the problem of increased food waste in Toronto, outlining the research and design process of the proposed solution as a mobile app.

		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-12 mt-4">
				<h2 class="sub-heading">Key Research Findings</h2>
				<p class="inner-p mt-2">When developing the project proposal, I conducted secondary research to gain a better understanding of the issue of food waste existing in Toronto, why current solution attempts have not lead to any significant improvements, and what challenge exist behind developing a cohesive solution. Key findings that identify the need for a solution include:

					<li>More than half of all food produced in Canada is wasted, and roughly one third of that food can be rescued and sent to communities in need</li>
					<li> Food waste in Toronto becomes a costly resource that contributes to economic and environmental concerns</li>
					<li> Wasted food tends to derive largely from production facilities, restaurants, and institutions, while existing initiatives only focus on individual food waste</li>

			<div class="row blue-background mt-4">
			<div class="col-md-12 mt-3">
				<h2 class="sub-heading">Solution</h2>
				<p class="inner-p mt-2">The solution I will explore is a mobile platform that connects both parties involved- donating organizations and organizations in need of rescued food- to be able to seamlessly connect and communicate, while also maintaining legal considerations that exist with food donation in Ontario; as well as educating parties on benefits to provide incentive.

				<h2 class="sub-heading">Product Ideation</h2>
				<p class="inner-p mt-2">Once the user was understood, I began with ideation of the user flow, brand design, as well as wireframe sketches in order to define the direction of the app. Based off the preliminary research findings and the user personas, the objectives the app should aim to meet include:

					<li>A way for businesses with excess food that can be rescued to easily connect with non-profit communities and share food items the moment they become available while staying educated on legality</li>
					<li> A way for non-profit organizations to easily view available product listings and accept the items that works for their organization</li>
					<li> A way for business donors and non-profit organizations to connect to share resources in the long term</li>

				<h2 class="mt-4">Business Donor Dashboard</h2><br>
				<p class="inner-p">This first dashboard is for the business donor's interface. A key feature is that it allows the donor to view the status of their donation posting, with the options being under review, awaiting match, successful donation, and rejected leading to the FAQ page for why their posting may have been rejected.
			The dashboard would also contain a notification screen with status notifications as well as community connection requests. Finally, the general posting board will also be displayed to encourage further submissions from donors.</p></div>

			<h2 class="mt-4">Business Donor Donate</h2><br>
			<p class="inner-p">The donation screen is the most crucial portion to the business donor side, as this is what allows the user to share their posting. This screen displays a form where users can simply add a posting, and include the item they are donating, the amount of that item, expiry date, and any additional information. They can post on the public donor board which would be available for all users to see, or just share with an organization they have connected to and it would appear for them specifically. Once submitted, it is reflected on the dashboard status section.

			<h2 class="">Non-Profit Organization Dashboard</h2><br>
			<p class="inner-p">This dashboard is created for the non-profit organization interface. Similar to the Business Donor view, the dashboard would consist of status updates on donations they wish to receive, and a notifications bar. The status updates would be successful delivery, pending approval, delivery, and denied, which would lead to the FAQ page for why it was denied.

			<p class="inner-p">Once the business donor creates a posting, it immediately reflects onto this screen. The donor board for non-profit is more detailed than business, as they actual have means of interaction with it. It shows the postings that the businesse donor made with the date and time, as well as any additional details on the posting. Once requesting a donation, the dashboard status is updated for both parties.

			<h2 class="mt-5">Connecting to the Community</h2><br>
			<p class="inner-p">The community screen exists for both the business donor and non-profit interfaces. For businesses, the community screen would allow donors to directly connect with participating non-profit organizations, so they can communicate and commit to donations for easier and more consistent postings. For non-profit's, it would display a list of business donors and participating organizations, and the user may request to connect if they desire seeing more of their postings more consistently.

				<h2 class="sub-heading">Reflection + Next Steps</h2>
				<p class="inner-p mt-2">This was my first passion project and personal UX case study. Wanting to use all the skills I have learned in my courses, I wanted to go through the entire design process and was able to create my first functional prototype. While I had thorough background research on the topic, I believe the project would be enhanced with UX research through user interviews with the parties involved, and user testing with different design iterations. The project is one that is immensely detailed, and realize that there are alot more screens to be made to display a few of the details that were mentioned but not included in the final design. Working alongside my professor I learned alot about the UX process and journey, and hope to apply these skills in upcoming projects.</p>
