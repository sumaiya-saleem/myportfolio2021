				<h2 class="sub-heading">Overview</h2>
				<p class="inner-p mt-2">Experiencing discomfort when trying to access and navigate the current voicemail system, we observed that this is a pain point among the majority of voicemail users. Therefore, we identified the need for a design change from the current audio management system to a visual system that would improve efficiency for users. Following an experimental design process, my partner and I created several design iterations conducting user testing for each, and using statistical analysis to determine the validity of the hypothesis.

				<h2 class="sub-heading">Sketches + Initial Ideation</h2>
				<p class="inner-p mt-2">For the initial ideation, we considered the different flaws with the current voicemail system, and what features would need to be included/removed for a better experience. Currently, voicemails are primarily audio-based, giving limited control to the user for sorting through voicemails, catching certain details in a voicemail, and deleting voicemails. As a result, this wastes users’ time and increases preventable frustration. Our proposed voicemail interface will allow users to visually see their voicemails and have easy control through buttons and interactive UI elements such as a progress bar, delete button, pin to top, etc. The measure of success variables will be time and user satisfaction.

				<h4>Scenarios</h4>

The voicemail content was kept different for audio voicemail system and visual voicemail system. The scenarios for the final testing session were as follows:
				<li>Task — play the voicemail sent by the doctor’s office, write down when your appt., delete the voicemail after</li>
					<li>Task — Find and play the two voicemails sent by Grandma, call her back after listening to both voicemails</li>
					<li>Task — Identify which voicemail is a spam call, delete the voicemail</li>

		<h5>Testing Variables —</h5>

			<li><strong>Dependent variables:</strong> To test the effectiveness, the variables measured would be completion rate, task completition time, and measure of ease according to NASA-TLX (to measure cognitive load) and 7 Single Ease Questions (SEQ). </li>
			<li><strong>Confound Variables</strong>: To avoid the learning effect, we did not have the same content of voicemails for each interface, but have the same type/importance. This ensures that we are tesing the our UI and not user knowledge, therefore keeping both the content of the message, and who the sender is different.</li>

				<h4><span class="yellow-highlight">Measuring Duration</span> - Analysis of Variance using ANOVA</h4>
				<p class="inner-p mt-2">This test was to measure whether there is a statistical difference between the audio voicemail system and the visual voicemail system in terms of task completion time. Based off the results, we can conclude there is a statistical difference between using the visual system over the audio system; we can reject the null hypothesis. There is statistical evidence to show a visual system provides a faster method, compared to the audio system, for checking and accessing voicemails on iPhones.

Therefore, the question to answer using the Friedman test is if there is any statistical significance between audio and visual voicemail systems. The test concluded that there is a statistical significance between audio and visual system, where the visual system is preferred over the audio system.

				<h2 class="sub-heading">Conclusion</h2>
				<p class="inner-p mt-2">This project commenced with identifying pain-points of iPhone users in regards to accessing voicemail. Currently, iPhones have an audio voicemail system with limited visual functions for the user to utilize. Through initial user interviews, we found users would like to have more control over their voicemail to reduce time and effort spent navigating their voicemails. Furthermore, through A/B testing and statistical analysis of an audio system and our prototype of a visual system, we can conclude there is a statistical significance to support our alternative hypothesis that the graphical playback controls of voicemails is more effective than the audio-only management of voicemail. Specifically, we found a visual system results in lower task time (i.e. it is faster), higher user interface satisfaction rates, and higher ease of use. Overall, the visual system aims to resolve the initial pain-points and frustrations of users and provide a better user experience.
